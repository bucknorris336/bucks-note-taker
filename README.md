## Description

```
This application uses an express backend, saving and retrieving JSON stored data. It can be used to write and save notes. You also have the option to delete them as well. The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file. The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. I built the back end, connected the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku. When opening the Note Taker, the user is presented with a landing page with links to a note page. When the user clicks the link to the notes page, they are presented with a landing page with some existing notes listed on the left side column. On the right side column, the user enters a new note title, note text, the save icon button apears. Once pressed, the note appears on the left hand side(with the other existing notes). When you click an existing note on the left land side, the note "opens" and apears on the right side. If you press the "+" icon, the user is presented with an emty field to enter a new note title and text in the right hand column. If you wish to delete that note or any other, the option is there. I hope you enjoy and find this application useful.
