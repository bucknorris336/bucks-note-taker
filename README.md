## Description

```
I created a note taker application that accepts user input infromation. It can be used to write and save notes. The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file. The application’s front end has already been created. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.
